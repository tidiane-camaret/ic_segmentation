## 2026-01-11: Improved Context Sampling with PatchWork Method

**Implemented label-balanced context patch sampling:**
- Replaced threshold-based foreground sampling with PatchWork's probability-weighted method
- Samples from all valid patch positions (not just sliding window grid), enabling much denser sampling
- Uses formula `background_p = (1 - ratio) * pos / (numvx * ratio - pos)` to achieve 50% foreground/background ratio
- Fixed coordinate tracking - now saves actual sampled positions instead of (0,0,0)

**Extended inspection system:**
- Added saving of image context inputs (`prev_lvl_img.nii.gz`, `prev_lvl_pred_mask.nii.gz`) - predictions from previous autoregressive levels
- Added full stitched predictions for each level (`{label}_level_{L}_full_pred_mask.nii.gz`)
- Allows visualization of prediction refinement from coarse to fine resolution

**Files modified:**
- `src/medverse_foreground_sampling.py`: Implemented `_sample_patch_center_balanced()`, removed old `_compute_foreground_patch_centers()` and `_sample_context_patches()`

**Testing:** Run with `python scripts/eval_totalseg.py --enable-inspection --max-inspect-cases 1 --context-size 3 --no-wandb`
